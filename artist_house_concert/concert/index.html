<p>“O lieb, so lang du lieben kannst”, originally a poem written by the revolutionary German poet, Ferdinand Freiligrath, was later made to music by the addition of a melody composed by the Hungarian Composer, Franz Liszt. The work delivers the following message: whenever one gets the opportunity to love someone, one should love that person passionately without any regrets. By this, no matter when the end shall be, if one has loved another and have loved each other without any regrets, the memories of those will always stay beautiful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Opera “Faust”, by Charles Gounod, features characters with distinct personalities each with their own symbolisms. The main character Faust, the philosopher, is a man who devotes his entire life to seek for the truth. Mephistopheles is the devil, who is after the soul of Faust and Marguerite, a lady who shows pure and devoted love to Faust. The libretto, “O Dieu, que de bijoux ‚Faust’” is about Faust falling in love with Marguerite and winning her heart through jewels, with the help of Mephistopheles, the Devil.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lucia awaits her maid, Alisa, and Esgardo, the enemy of her family. Alisa, knowing everything about this, warns Lucia how dangerous this meeting could mean. However,  Lucia, who has already fallen in love with Esgardo, does not listen to her.
Lucia looks in the fountain and sees someone waving at her. The maid had killed herself by throwing herself into the water because she fell in love with a lord. Seeing this, she starts singing, “Regnava nel Silenzio ,Lucia di Lammermoor’”, which means, “silence reigned in the dark and deep night”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The arias sung by the Queen of the Night in Mozart’s Opera “The Magic Flute” are recognised as one of the best opera arias. Among other arias, “O zittre nicht, mein lieber Sohn” in the first act, requires extra attention and techniques in order to understand and express the song completely as how it is. This aria is about the Queen of the Night begging Prince Tamino to save her kidnapped daughter, Princess Pamina. If he is successful, she promises to give her daughter to him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>”A Thousand Winds” was written by Mary Elizabeth Frye around 1983. The song was unofficially published. This song is her most well-known, and her final work. The lyric is about Margaret Schwarz not being able to show sorrow at her mother’s grave due to the racial law made by the National Socialist German Workers’ Party.</p>
